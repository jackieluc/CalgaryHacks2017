## Theme
**Automation and Optimization**

## Purpose
We wanted to optimize and maximize the learning potential within a university environment by allowing students to submit questions and submit feedback to the professor in real-time. This enables instructors to gauge their teaching and receive feedback in real-time to adjust to the student's needs. Students can submit questions that everyone in the class can see and "up-vote" a popular question to gain priority in receiving a verbal answer from the professor. If a certain question exceeds a certain amount of up-votes, then the professor would be notified to address the question(s). These questions are stored in lecture sessions that are identified by dates and the course and can be reviewed in the future, even after the lecture ends.
